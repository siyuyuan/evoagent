ZEROSHOT_REACT_INSTRUCTION = """Collect information for a query plan using interleaving 'Thought', 'Action', and 'Observation' steps. Ensure you gather valid information related to transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation. All information should be written in Notebook, which will then be input into the Planner tool. Note that the nested use of tools is prohibited. 'Thought' can reason about the current situation, and 'Action' can have 8 different types:
(1) FlightSearch[Departure City, Destination City, Date]:
Description: A flight information retrieval tool.
Parameters:
Departure City: The city you'll be flying out from.
Destination City: The city you aim to reach.
Date: The date of your travel in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Example: FlightSearch[New York, London, 2022-10-01] would fetch flights from New York to London on October 1, 2022.

(2) GoogleDistanceMatrix[Origin, Destination, Mode]:
Description: Estimate the distance, time and cost between two cities.
Parameters:
Origin: The departure city of your journey.
Destination: The destination city of your journey.
Mode: The method of transportation. Choices include 'self-driving' and 'taxi'.
Example: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Paris, Lyon, self-driving] would provide driving distance, time and cost between Paris and Lyon.

(3) AccommodationSearch[City]:
Description: Discover accommodations in your desired city.
Parameter: City - The name of the city where you're seeking accommodation.
Example: AccommodationSearch[Rome] would present a list of hotel rooms in Rome.

(4) RestaurantSearch[City]:
Description: Explore dining options in a city of your choice.
Parameter: City – The name of the city where you're seeking restaurants.
Example: RestaurantSearch[Tokyo] would show a curated list of restaurants in Tokyo.

(5) AttractionSearch[City]:
Description: Find attractions in a city of your choice.
Parameter: City – The name of the city where you're seeking attractions.
Example: AttractionSearch[London] would return attractions in London.

(6) CitySearch[State]
Description: Find cities in a state of your choice.
Parameter: State – The name of the state where you're seeking cities.
Example: CitySearch[California] would return cities in California.

(7) NotebookWrite[Short Description]
Description: Writes a new data entry into the Notebook tool with a short description. This tool should be used immediately after FlightSearch, AccommodationSearch, AttractionSearch, RestaurantSearch or GoogleDistanceMatrix. Only the data stored in Notebook can be seen by Planner. So you should write all the information you need into Notebook.
Parameters: Short Description - A brief description or label for the stored data. You don't need to write all the information in the description. The data you've searched for will be automatically stored in the Notebook.
Example: NotebookWrite[Flights from Rome to Paris in 2022-02-01] would store the informatrion of flights from Rome to Paris in 2022-02-01 in the Notebook.

(8) Planner[Query]
Description: A smart planning tool that crafts detailed plans based on user input and the information stroed in Notebook.
Parameters: 
Query: The query from user.
Example: Planner[Give me a 3-day trip plan from Seattle to New York] would return a detailed 3-day trip plan.
You should use as many as possible steps to collect engough information to input to the Planner tool. 

Each action only calls one function once. Do not add any description in the action.
